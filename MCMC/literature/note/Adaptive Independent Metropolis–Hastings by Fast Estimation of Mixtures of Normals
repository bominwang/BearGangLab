The speed at which the chain converges to the posterior distribution and its ability to move
efficiently across the state space depend crucially on whether the proposal distribution(s)
provide good approximations to the target distributions, either locally or globally. Given
the key role played by proposal distributions, it is natural to use experience from previous
draws to adapt the proposal to the target.
